        <h1>Indian Laws by Supreme Court of India</h1>
        <h2>Legal Framework:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960:</b> This Act prohibits cruelty to animals, including street dogs. Under Section 9(k), it is illegal for housing societies to pass bye-laws that debar pets, even if a majority of residents vote in favor.</li>
            <li><b>Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 428 and 429:</b> These sections make it a criminal offense to maim or cause harm to animals, including street dogs, with punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment.</li>
            <li><b>Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules:</b> Mandated under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, these rules emphasize the sterilization and vaccination of street dogs as a humane method of population control. The Supreme Court has emphasized the implementation of the ABC program and stated that municipalities cannot engage in indiscriminate killings of street animals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Supreme Court Rulings:</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court of India has underscored the humane treatment of street dogs and the importance of implementing the ABC program. In a notable case, the Court stayed an order from the Bombay High Court that directed the reintroduction of approximately 60 stray dogs into a housing society in Pune after a dog bite incident. The Supreme Court sought responses from animal rights activists and emphasized the need for a balanced approach to address such issues.</p>

        <h2>Guidelines for Housing Societies:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>No Bans on Pets:</b> Housing societies cannot ban residents from keeping pets based on breed, size, or behavior, such as barking. Such restrictions are illegal under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.</li>
            <li><b>Feeding of Street Dogs:</b> Residents are allowed to feed street dogs. The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) guidelines state that even if a majority of residents want it, Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and Apartment Owners Associations (AOAs) cannot legally introduce a ban on feeding street dogs.</li>
            <li><b>Use of Common Facilities:</b> Pets cannot be barred from using common facilities like lifts and parks, nor can societies impose fines or special charges for the same.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Indian laws and Supreme Court rulings advocate for the humane treatment of street dogs and protect the rights of residents to keep pets. Housing societies must adhere to these laws, ensuring that no illegal restrictions are imposed on pet ownership or the feeding of street dogs. For detailed information, refer to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and the Animal Welfare Board of India's guidelines.</p>
